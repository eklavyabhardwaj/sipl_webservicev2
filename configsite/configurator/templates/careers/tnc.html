      You are responsible for ensuring that all information you provide in your application is

      reasoning.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p class="p">
      You agree not to disclose any confidential or proprietary information obtained during the
      recruitment process. This obligation continues even if your application is unsuccessful.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2">6. Governing Law</h2>
    <p class="p">
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction
